# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTR(name, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTR(name, 2, LENGTH(name)))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id ASC;

-- faster than substring method
SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name, 1)), LOWER(RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1))) AS name
FROM users
ORDER BY user_id ASC;
