SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary in (SELECT Salary FROM Employee HAVING Salary <> (SELECT MAX(Salary) From Employee));


-- find all the salry less than max salary, and find out the max out of them
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);

-- LeetCode Solution
SELECT  
IFNULL(
    (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
     FROM Employee
     ORDER BY Salary DESC
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), null
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
