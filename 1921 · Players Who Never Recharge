-- Write your SQL Query here --
-- example: SELECT * FROM XX_TABLE WHERE XXX --
SELECT name as player
FROM users
WHERE id != ALL (SELECT user_id FROM recharges);
-- This is useful as, ALL logical operator, will compare all the ids of the table player, which
-- are not equal to the subquery result..
